Two VOTABLE examples for service descriptor IRL templating

GAIADR2CepheidParams.vot contains Cepheid variability parameters. A service is decribed which allows to retrieve the record of the associated DR2 source in the main catalog in various formats

GAIADR2meanvelocities.vot contains mean radial velocities for for GAIA sources. 4 services are defined : 
- one allows to retrieve each record in another format,

- one allows to retrieve the source record in the main GAIA catalog

- one allows to retrieve the original ground based velocity measurements for the source

- one describes each record flag
